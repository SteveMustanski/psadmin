This project is from an pluralsight course on using react and flux.

I wanted to go through this course to get a feel for older patterns and get some experience doing some of
of the things that using create-react-app does for you. For example, this project uses gulp for building the application.

Also, there is a mix of ES5 and ES6 as some of the examples where in ES5 with older modules making it difficult to compelete
tasks without following along with the older syntax.

Some of the gulp packages specified in the course were outdated and these were upgraded to gulp 4.0
in this repo.
